### Best Practices

To maximize the effectiveness of popups while maintaining a positive user experience on the Tonga National Portal:

   - Avoid showing popups immediately when users land on the site
   - Allow users to engage with content before displaying popups (15-30 second delay)
   - Limit the number of popups shown in a single session
   - Use cookies to prevent showing the same popup repeatedly to returning visitors

2. **Responsive Design Considerations**:
   - Create separate popup configurations for mobile and desktop users
   - Use smaller, less intrusive popups on mobile devices
   - Ensure text is readable without zooming on all screen sizes
   - Test popups across multiple devices and browsers
   - Make close buttons easily tappable on touch screens
