## WordPress Architecture Overview

<Card title="Platform Foundation" icon="wordpress">
  The Tonga National Portal is built on WordPress 6.8.1, a robust and flexible content management system that powers over 40% of websites worldwide. The platform leverages WordPress's core functionality while extending it with plugins to meet the specific needs of Tonga's government services portal.
</Card>

### Core Architecture

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Non-Technical Overview">
    The Tonga National Portal uses WordPress as its foundation, which can be thought of as a digital framework that manages all the content and functionality of the website. Think of WordPress as the engine and chassis of a car, while the plugins, themes, and design elements are like the body, interior, and special features that make it uniquely suited for Tonga's government services.

    The WordPress architecture consists of several key components:

    1. **Core System**: The fundamental WordPress software that provides basic functionality
    2. **Theme**: The Bricks Builder theme that controls how the portal looks and behaves
    3. **Plugins**: Additional software components that extend functionality
    4. **Database**: Where all content and settings are stored
    5. **Media Library**: Storage system for images, documents, and other files

    This architecture allows for:

    - **Ease of Content Management**: Government staff can easily update content without technical knowledge
    - **Flexibility**: The portal can be extended with new features as needs evolve
    - **Security**: Regular updates to protect against vulnerabilities
    - **Scalability**: The ability to handle increasing amounts of content and traffic
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Technical Implementation">
    From a technical perspective, the WordPress architecture follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern, although with some WordPress-specific adaptations:

    - **Model**: WordPress's database abstraction layer and core functions that interact with the database
    - **View**: Theme templates and Bricks Builder elements that render the front-end interface
    - **Controller**: WordPress core functions, hooks system, and custom PHP code that process requests

    The request lifecycle in WordPress follows this general flow:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Request Initiation">
        A user requests a URL on the Tonga National Portal
      </Step>
      <Step title="Routing">
        WordPress's core routing system determines what content to display
      </Step>
      <Step title="Template Loading">
        The appropriate template files from the theme are loaded
      </Step>
      <Step title="Content Processing">
        Hooks and filters modify and enhance the content
      </Step>
      <Step title="Rendering">
        The final HTML is rendered and sent to the user's browser
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
### Extension Architecture

The Tonga National Portal extends the core WordPress architecture through:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Custom Post Types" icon="box">
    Specialized content types for government services, departments, forms, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Taxonomies" icon="tags">
    Classification systems for organizing content
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom Fields" icon="list-check">
    Additional data associated with content
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bricks Builder Templates" icon="layer-group">
    Specialized layouts for different types of content
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This extension architecture allows the portal to serve as a comprehensive government services platform while maintaining the benefits of the WordPress ecosystem.

## Database Structure

WordPress uses a relational database (MySQL 8.0) with a specific schema for the Tonga National Portal.

### Core WordPress Tables

<Accordion title="Standard WordPress Database Tables">
  The standard WordPress database includes these core tables:

  1. **wp_posts**: Stores all content including pages, posts, attachments, and custom post types
  2. **wp_users**: Contains user account information
  3. **wp_usermeta**: Stores additional user metadata
  4. **wp_comments**: Holds comments and comment metadata
  5. **wp_terms**, **wp_term_taxonomy**, **wp_term_relationships**: Manage categories, tags, and custom taxonomies
  6. **wp_options**: Stores site configuration settings
  7. **wp_postmeta**: Contains additional metadata for posts and pages
</Accordion>

### Plugin Tables

<Accordion title="Plugin-specific Database Tables">
  The database also includes tables created by installed plugins:

  1. **wp_actionscheduler_***:  Tables for the Action Scheduler library used by various plugins
  2. **wp_bricks_***:  Tables for the Bricks Builder theme functionality
  3. **wp_core_framework_presets**: Stores presets for the Core Framework plugin
  4. **wp_fs_***: Tables for the FS Poster Lite plugin
  5. **wp_icl_***: Tables for the WPML multilingual plugin (Sitepress Multilingual CMS)
  6. **wp_mxchat_***: Tables for the MXChat Basic plugin
  7. **wp_userfeedback_***: Tables for the UserFeedback Premium plugin
  8. **wp_wpmailsmtp_***: Tables for the WP Mail SMTP plugin
</Accordion>
### Database Relationships

The database uses several key relationships to connect different types of content:

```mermaid
erDiagram
    wp_users ||--o{ wp_usermeta : "stores metadata for"
    wp_posts ||--o{ wp_postmeta : "stores metadata for"
    wp_posts ||--o{ wp_term_relationships : "categorized by"
    wp_terms ||--o{ wp_term_taxonomy : "defines taxonomy for"
    wp_term_taxonomy ||--o{ wp_term_relationships : "relates to"
    wp_options {
        option_id int PK
        option_name varchar
        option_value longtext
        autoload varchar
    }
```

<Callout type="info" title="Technical Context for IT Staff">
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Performance Implications:</strong> The `wp_posts` and `wp_postmeta` tables grow the fastest and can impact query performance. Consider implementing table partitioning for these tables if content exceeds 100,000 entries.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Indexing Strategy:</strong> Custom indexes should be added to `wp_postmeta` for meta_keys that are frequently queried, especially for custom fields used in government service listings.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Backup Considerations:</strong> The relationship between posts and metadata means both tables must be backed up simultaneously to maintain referential integrity.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Security Note:</strong> User data in `wp_users` and `wp_usermeta` contains sensitive information. Ensure database-level encryption and proper access controls.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Maintenance Tip:</strong> Regular optimization of these tables (particularly `wp_options` which can accumulate transients) is essential for maintaining performance.
  </div>
</Callout>

### Technical Details

<Callout type="note">
  The database uses InnoDB as the storage engine, with UTF-8mb4 character encoding to support multilingual content (both English and Tongan). Indexes are created on frequently queried columns to optimize performance.
</Callout>

## File System Organization

The Tonga National Portal follows WordPress's standard file system organization with additional directories and files for plugins and themes.

### Core Directory Structure

```
<Callout type="warning" title="Technical Context for IT Staff">
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>File Permissions:</strong> Critical security consideration - `wp-admin` and `wp-includes` should be set to 755, while configuration files should be 440/400.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Deployment Pipeline:</strong> When deploying updates, exclude the `wp-content/uploads` directory to prevent overwriting user-uploaded content.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Backup Strategy:</strong> Implement differential backups for the `wp-content/uploads` directory (which grows rapidly) and full backups for the rest of the installation.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> The `wp-content/plugins` directory contains 16 active plugins, which can impact load times. Consider implementing a plugin audit process to maintain only essential functionality.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Security Scanning:</strong> Regular malware scans should focus on the `wp-content` directory, particularly the `uploads` folder, which is the most common target for malicious file uploads.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Maintenance Workflow:</strong> When updating WordPress core, create a staging environment first to test compatibility with the custom Bricks theme and Core Framework plugin.
  </div>
</Callout>

### Bricks Theme Structure

The Bricks theme used for the Tonga National Portal follows a modular organization:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[bricks] --> B[assets]
    A --> C[includes]
    A --> D[template-parts]
    A --> E[languages]
    A --> F[functions.php]
    A --> G[style.css]
    A --> H[other theme files]
    
    B --> B1[css]
    B --> B2[js]
    B --> B3[fonts]
    B --> B4[images]
    
    C --> C1[admin.php]

    C --> C5[other includes]
    
    D --> D1[builder.php]
    D --> D2[content.php]
    D --> D3[page.php]
    D --> D4[post.php]
```

<Callout type="info" title="Technical Context for IT Staff">
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Customization Strategy:</strong> Custom modifications should be implemented through child themes or the Core Framework plugin rather than directly editing Bricks theme files to maintain upgrade compatibility.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Performance Considerations:</strong> The `assets/js` directory contains JavaScript files that should be minified and combined in production to reduce HTTP requests and improve page load times.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Critical Files:</strong> `functions.php` and `includes/elements.php` are the most critical files for theme functionality - changes here can have cascading effects throughout the site.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Caching Implementation:</strong> Implement browser caching for the `assets` directory with appropriate cache headers (1 week for CSS/JS, 1 month for fonts/images).
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Maintenance Workflow:</strong> When updating the Bricks theme, always back up the `includes/templates.php` file as it contains custom template configurations specific to the Tonga National Portal.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Security Note:</strong> The theme's PHP files, especially in the `includes` directory, should be regularly audited for security vulnerabilities as they execute with the same privileges as WordPress core.
  </div>
</Callout>
### Core Framework Plugin Structure

The Core Framework plugin provides additional functionality for the Tonga National Portal:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[core-framework] --> B[assets]
    A --> C[gutenberg]
    A --> D[gutenberg-blocks]
    A --> E[languages]
    A --> F[wp]
    A --> G[core-framework.php]
    A --> H[index.php]
```

<Callout type="warning" title="Technical Context for IT Staff">
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Critical Component:</strong> The Core Framework plugin is a foundational component that extends WordPress functionality specifically for the Tonga National Portal. Any failure in this plugin will affect multiple site features.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Dependency Chain:</strong> This plugin is a dependency for several custom features in the Bricks theme implementation. Updates must be tested thoroughly in staging before deployment.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Custom Development:</strong> The `wp` directory contains custom WordPress hooks and filters that integrate with core WordPress functionality. Changes here require thorough testing across the entire site.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Performance Impact:</strong> The Gutenberg blocks implemented in the `gutenberg` and `gutenberg-blocks` directories add custom editor functionality but can impact admin dashboard performance on lower-end devices.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Versioning Strategy:</strong> Implement semantic versioning for this plugin with detailed changelog documentation to track changes over time.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Security Consideration:</strong> The `index.php` file prevents directory listing and should never be modified or removed as it's a security measure.
  </div>
</Callout>

## Theme Structure Using Bricks Template Builder

The Tonga National Portal uses the Bricks Builder as its template builder, providing a flexible and powerful way to create and manage the portal's design and layout.

### Bricks Builder Overview

<Card title="Visual Page Builder" icon="paintbrush">
  Bricks Builder is a visual page builder for WordPress that allows for the creation of complex layouts without writing code. It uses a modular approach with elements that can be combined to create pages.
</Card>

#### Key Components

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Templates" icon="file-code">
    Pre-designed layouts that can be applied to different types of content
  </Card>
  <Card title="Sections" icon="puzzle-piece">
    Reusable layout blocks that can be included in multiple pages
  </Card>
  <Card title="Elements" icon="cubes">
    Individual components like text, images, buttons, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Global Settings" icon="gear">
    Site-wide design settings for consistency
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Bricks Templates System

The Bricks theme uses a custom post type called `bricks_template` to store templates. These templates can be assigned to different parts of the site:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Header Templates">
    Applied to the site header
  </Step>
  <Step title="Content Templates">
    Applied to the main content area
  </Step>
  <Step title="Footer Templates">
    Applied to the site footer
  </Step>
  <Step title="Single Templates">
    Applied to individual posts or pages
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="note">
  Templates can be assigned based on conditions, such as post type, taxonomy, or specific pages.
</Callout>
### Template Hierarchy

The template hierarchy determines which template is used for different types of content:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A[Default Template] --> B[Content Type Templates]
    B --> C[Taxonomy/Term Templates]
    C --> D[Individual Page Templates]
    
    style A fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f0f0f0,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#e6e6e6,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#dcdcdc,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

<Callout type="info" title="Technical Context for IT Staff">
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Template Resolution Performance:</strong> The template hierarchy follows a cascade pattern where WordPress checks for increasingly specific templates. This process can impact page load times if the hierarchy is too deep or complex.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Caching Strategy:</strong> Implement page caching with different TTL (Time To Live) values based on template specificity - longer cache times for default templates, shorter for specific page templates.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Development Workflow:</strong> When creating new templates, start with the most specific level needed to minimize the cascade effect and improve rendering performance.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Maintenance Consideration:</strong> Template changes at higher levels (Default Template) will affect all content unless overridden by more specific templates. Always test changes at the Default Template level across multiple content types.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Multilingual Implementation:</strong> With WPML active, each template in this hierarchy may have language-specific versions, effectively doubling the template complexity. Ensure language-specific templates follow the same hierarchy.
  </div>
  <div className="mt-2">
    <strong>Debugging Tip:</strong> When troubleshooting template issues, use the 'What Template' plugin or add `<?php global $template; echo $template; ?>` to identify which template file is being used for a specific page.
  </div>
</Callout>

### Technical Implementation

<Callout type="note">
  Bricks templates are stored in the WordPress database and can be exported/imported as JSON files. The templates use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with dynamic content inserted through WordPress functions and custom code.
</Callout>
