## Content Management

### Posts

#### Definition

Posts are the primary content type in WordPress, representing dynamic, chronological entries such as blog articles, news updates, or announcements. They form the foundation of WordPress's content management system and are designed to be regularly updated and organized using categories and tags.

Key characteristics of Posts include:

- **Chronological organization**: Posts are displayed in reverse chronological order (newest first) by default
- **Categorization and tagging**: Posts can be organized using hierarchical categories and non-hierarchical tags
- **Archives**: Automatically organized into date-based archives (yearly, monthly, daily)
- **RSS feed integration**: Automatically included in the site's RSS feed for syndication
- **Comments**: Built-in commenting system for reader engagement
- **Permalinks**: Customizable URL structures for better SEO and readability
- **Featured images**: Visual representation of the post content
- **Excerpts**: Short summaries that can be displayed in listings

Posts are distinct from Pages (which are static, hierarchical content) and are ideal for time-sensitive content that benefits from chronological organization and categorization.

### Pages

#### Definition

Pages are static, standalone content in WordPress designed for timeless information that isn't part of the regular chronological blog content flow. They represent permanent or semi-permanent content such as "About Us," "Contact," "Services," or "Privacy Policy" sections of a website.

Key characteristics of Pages include:

- **Hierarchical structure**: Pages can have parent-child relationships, creating nested navigation
- **Static content**: Designed for information that doesn't change frequently
- **No categorization or tagging**: Pages don't use the standard WordPress taxonomy system
- **No date organization**: Pages aren't organized chronologically or displayed in date archives
- **Custom templates**: Many themes offer page-specific templates for different layouts
- **Menu integration**: Commonly used as primary navigation items
- **No RSS inclusion**: Pages aren't included in the site's RSS feed by default
- **Permalinks**: Typically have simpler URL structures than posts

Pages are distinct from Posts (which are chronological, categorized content entries) and are ideal for essential website information that needs to be easily accessible and isn't time-sensitive.
