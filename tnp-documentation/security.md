# WordPress Security Guide: Understanding and Securing Your WordPress Website

## 1. Introduction to WordPress Security

WordPress security is a critical aspect of website management that requires ongoing attention. As the most popular content management system (CMS) powering over 40% of all websites on the internet, WordPress is a frequent target for hackers and malicious actors. This document provides a comprehensive overview of WordPress security, from understanding the baseline security of a clean installation to implementing best practices for maintaining a secure website.

## 2. Security of a Clean WordPress Installation

### 2.1 Core Security Features

A fresh WordPress installation includes several built-in security features:

- **User Authentication System**: WordPress has a robust user authentication system with role-based access control.
- **Password Security**: WordPress enforces strong password policies and securely stores passwords using hashing algorithms.
- **Automatic Updates**: WordPress supports automatic background updates for minor releases and security patches.
- **Database Security**: WordPress uses prepared SQL statements to prevent SQL injection attacks.
- **File Permissions**: WordPress recommends specific file permissions to protect system files.
- **Security Headers**: WordPress implements various security headers to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

### 2.2 Security Limitations

Despite these features, a clean WordPress installation has several security limitations:

- **Default Settings**: Many default settings prioritize usability over security.
- **Open Registration**: By default, anyone can register for an account if user registration is enabled.
- **Plugin/Theme Vulnerabilities**: The ability to extend WordPress through plugins and themes introduces potential security risks.
- **Visible Version Information**: WordPress displays version information that can help attackers identify vulnerabilities.
- **Login Page Vulnerabilities**: The standard login page (/wp-login.php) is vulnerable to brute force attacks.

## 3. Common WordPress Security Vulnerabilities

### 3.1 Authentication Vulnerabilities
- Weak passwords
- Brute force attacks
- Session hijacking

### 3.2 Authorization Vulnerabilities
- Privilege escalation
- Unauthorized access to protected content

### 3.3 Code Vulnerabilities
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Remote code execution

### 3.4 Server and Hosting Vulnerabilities
- Outdated server software
- Insecure file permissions
- Shared hosting risks

## 4. Best Security Practices

### 4.1 Server-Level Security

#### 4.1.1 File Permissions

Set proper file permissions to prevent unauthorized access:

```
# Set directory permissions to 755
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# Set file permissions to 644
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

Critical files should have more restrictive permissions:
```
600 -rw-------  /home/user/wp-config.php
```

#### 4.1.2 Web Server Configuration

**Apache Configuration**:

Protect wp-config.php:
```
<Files "wp-config.php">
Require all denied
</Files>
```

Secure wp-includes directory:
```
# Block the include-only files
<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
RewriteEngine On
RewriteBase /
RewriteRule ^wp-admin/includes/ - [F,L]
RewriteRule !^wp-includes/ - [S=3]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/[^/]+\.php$ - [F,L]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/.+\.php - [F,L]
RewriteRule ^wp-includes/theme-compat/ - [F,L]
</IfModule>
```

**Nginx Configuration**:

```
# Global restrictions configuration
location = /favicon.ico {
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
}

location = /robots.txt {
    allow all;
    log_not_found off;
    access_log off;
}

# Deny all attempts to access hidden files
location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
}

# Deny access to PHP files in uploads directory
location ~* /(?:uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {
    deny all;
}
```

#### 4.1.3 SSL/TLS Implementation

- Implement HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure proper SSL settings:

```
# Force HTTPS for admin and login
define( 'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true );
```

For sites behind a reverse proxy:
```
define( 'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true );
if( strpos( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'], 'https') !== false )
    $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
```

#### 4.1.4 PHP Configuration

- Keep PHP updated to the latest stable version
- Configure PHP securely:

```
# Enable OpCache security settings
opcache.validate_permission = On
opcache.validate_root = On
opcache.restrict_api = '/some/folder/path'
```

### 4.2 WordPress Core Security

#### 4.2.1 Keep WordPress Updated

- Enable automatic updates for minor releases:
```
add_filter( 'auto_update_core', '__return_true' );
```

- Regularly check for and apply major updates

#### 4.2.2 Secure wp-config.php

- Move wp-config.php outside the web root
- Add security keys and salts:
```
define('AUTH_KEY',         'unique random string');
define('SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'unique random string');
define('LOGGED_IN_KEY',    'unique random string');
define('NONCE_KEY',        'unique random string');
define('AUTH_SALT',        'unique random string');
define('SECURE_AUTH_SALT', 'unique random string');
define('LOGGED_IN_SALT',   'unique random string');
define('NONCE_SALT',       'unique random string');
```

- Disable file editing in the admin area:
```
define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true );
```

- Use a custom database table prefix:
```
$table_prefix = 'unique_prefix_'; // Only numbers, letters, and underscores
```

#### 4.2.3 Secure WordPress Login

- Implement two-factor authentication
- Limit login attempts
- Change the default login URL
- Block access to wp-login.php from unauthorized IPs:

```
# Apache 2.4
<Files wp-login.php>
    Require ip 203.0.113.15
</Files>

# Nginx
location /wp-login.php {
    allow   203.0.113.15;
    deny    all;
}
```

### 4.3 Plugin and Theme Security

#### 4.3.1 Plugin Management

- Use plugins from reputable sources
- Keep plugins updated
- Remove unused plugins
- Regularly audit installed plugins
- Research plugins before installation (check reviews, last update, support)

#### 4.3.2 Theme Security

- Use themes from reputable sources
- Keep themes updated
- Remove unused themes
- Use child themes for customizations

### 4.4 User Management

#### 4.4.1 User Roles and Permissions

- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Regularly audit user accounts and roles
- Remove unnecessary user accounts

#### 4.4.2 Password Policies

- Enforce strong password requirements
- Implement regular password changes
