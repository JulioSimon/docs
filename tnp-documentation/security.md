# Security

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Tonga National Portal (TNP) platform to ensure data protection, system integrity, and compliance with relevant standards and regulations.

## 1. Security Architecture Overview

The Tonga National Portal implements a multi-layered security architecture designed to protect against various threats while ensuring system availability and data integrity. Our approach includes:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple security controls at different layers of the application
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and processes operate with minimal necessary permissions
- **Security by Design**: Security considerations integrated throughout the development lifecycle
- **Regular Security Assessments**: Continuous evaluation and improvement of security measures

The security architecture encompasses infrastructure security, application security, data security, and operational security to provide comprehensive protection for the portal and its users.

## 2. WordPress Core Security Measures

## 4. User Authentication and Authorization

The TNP implements robust user authentication and authorization mechanisms:

### Authentication

- **Strong Password Policy**: Enforcement of complex passwords with regular rotation
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Additional verification layer beyond passwords
- **Login Attempt Limitations**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Secure Password Recovery**: Secure process for password resets
- **Session Management**: Secure handling of user sessions with appropriate timeouts

### Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Granular permission management
- **Custom User Roles**: Tailored roles specific to TNP requirements
- **Permission Auditing**: Regular review of user permissions
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users granted only necessary permissions
- **Access Request Workflow**: Formal process for requesting elevated permissions

## 5. Data Protection and Privacy Measures

The TNP implements comprehensive data protection measures:

- **Data Classification**: Categorization of data based on sensitivity
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption of sensitive data both at rest and in transit
- **Data Minimization**: Collection of only necessary personal information
- **Data Retention Policies**: Clear policies on how long data is stored
- **Privacy by Design**: Privacy considerations integrated into all features
- **Consent Management**: Tools for managing user consent for data processing
- **Data Access Controls**: Strict controls on who can access different types of data
- **Data Processing Agreements**: Formal agreements with any third-party data processors

## 6. SSL/TLS Implementation

The TNP uses strong encryption for all communications:

- **TLS 1.2/1.3**: Implementation of modern TLS protocols
- **Strong Cipher Suites**: Use of secure cipher configurations
- **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security)**: Forcing secure connections
- **Certificate Management**: Regular renewal and validation of SSL certificates
- **Mixed Content Prevention**: Ensuring all resources load over HTTPS
- **Certificate Transparency**: Monitoring for unauthorized certificates

## 7. Firewall and Malware Protection

The TNP employs multiple layers of protection against attacks and malicious code:

### Web Application Firewall (WAF)

- **Rule-Based Protection**: Custom and pre-configured rules to block common attacks
- **IP Blocking**: Blocking of suspicious IP addresses
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevention of DoS attacks through request limiting
- **Geographic Restrictions**: Optional blocking of traffic from high-risk regions

### Malware Protection

- **Regular Scanning**: Automated scanning for malware and suspicious code
- **File Integrity Monitoring**: Detection of unauthorized file changes
- **Malware Removal Tools**: Tools for removing detected malware
- **Code Signing**: Verification of code authenticity

## 8. Backup and Disaster Recovery

The TNP implements comprehensive backup and recovery procedures:

- **Automated Backups**: Regular scheduled backups of all system components
- **Offsite Storage**: Secure storage of backups in separate locations
- **Encrypted Backups**: Encryption of backup data
- **Backup Testing**: Regular testing of backup restoration process
- **Disaster Recovery Plan**: Documented procedures for various disaster scenarios
- **Recovery Time Objectives (RTO)**: Defined timeframes for system recovery
- **Recovery Point Objectives (RPO)**: Maximum acceptable data loss periods

## 9. Security Monitoring and Logging

The TNP implements comprehensive monitoring to detect and respond to security events:

- **Centralized Logging**: Collection of logs from all system components
- **Log Retention**: Secure storage of logs for compliance and forensic purposes
- **Real-time Alerting**: Immediate notification of suspicious activities
- **Log Analysis**: Regular review and analysis of security logs
- **User Activity Monitoring**: Tracking of user actions for security purposes
- **System Performance Monitoring**: Detection of anomalies that may indicate security issues
- **Intrusion Detection**: Monitoring for signs of unauthorized access

## 10. Security Best Practices for Administrators

Administrators should follow these security best practices:

- **Use Strong Authentication**: Implement MFA for all administrative accounts
- **Regular Password Changes**: Change administrative passwords periodically
- **Secure Admin Access**: Access administrative interfaces only from secure networks
- **Regular Updates**: Keep all components updated with security patches
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use administrator accounts only when necessary
- **Security Training**: Stay informed about security threats and best practices
- **Audit Logs Review**: Regularly review security logs for suspicious activity
- **Clean Desk Policy**: Ensure sensitive information is not physically exposed
- **Secure Communication**: Use encrypted channels for administrative communication
- **Account Management**: Promptly disable accounts of departed staff

## 11. Incident Response Procedures

The TNP has established procedures for responding to security incidents:

### Incident Response Plan

1. **Detection and Reporting**: Processes for identifying and reporting security incidents

3. **Containment**: Measures to limit the damage of an incident
4. **Eradication**: Removal of the threat from the system
5. **Recovery**: Restoration of affected systems to normal operation
6. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Review of the incident and response for improvement

### Incident Response Team
