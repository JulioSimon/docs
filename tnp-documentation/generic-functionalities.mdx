### Login Process

The WordPress login process follows a structured sequence of steps to verify user identity and establish a secure session. Below is a detailed explanation of the standard login workflow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accessing the Login Page">
    - Navigate to the login URL
    - The system presents a login form requesting username/email and password
    
    <Frame>
      ![Login form showing username and password fields](./../images/tnp/gf1.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Credential Submission">
    - User enters their username or email address and password
    - User clicks the "Log In" button or presses Enter to submit credentials
    - The form data is submitted via POST request to the server
  </Step>
  <Step title="Server-side Validation">
    - WordPress validates the submitted credentials against stored user data
    - The system checks if the username/email exists in the database
    - If found, the submitted password is verified against the stored password hash
    - Failed login attempts may trigger security measures (like temporary lockouts)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Session Establishment">
    - Upon successful validation, WordPress creates a new authenticated session
    - Authentication cookies are set in the user's browser:
      - `wordpress_[hash]`: Contains the authenticated user information
      - `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]`: Indicates the user is logged in
      - `wordpress_sec_[hash]`: Used for password-based cookie authentication
    - These cookies are encrypted and contain expiration timestamps
  </Step>
  <Step title="Redirection">
    - New users are typically directed to their profile page
    - Returning users are redirected to:
      - The admin dashboard by default
      - A specific page if a redirect parameter was included in the login URL
      - The page they were attempting to access before being prompted to log in
      
    <Frame>
      ![Admin dashboard after successful login](./../images/tnp/gf2.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Important Security Considerations:**

  - WordPress uses nonces (number used once) to prevent CSRF attacks during login
  - Failed login attempts are logged and may trigger security measures
  - The login page can be protected with additional security layers (like 2FA)
  - All login communication should occur over HTTPS to prevent credential interception
</Warning>

    - You'll see two options:
      - **Create new**: Create a completely new menu for this language
      - **Translate existing**: Create a translated version of the current menu
    - Select "Translate existing" to maintain the same structure
    - Click "Create" to generate the translated menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Translating Menu Items">
    - After creating the translated menu, you'll see the original menu structure
    - Each menu item will have a "Translate" link next to it
    - Click "Translate" to open the translation panel for that item
    - Enter the translated text for:
      - **Navigation Label**: The visible menu text
      - **Title Attribute**: The tooltip text (if used)
    - Click "Save" to apply the translation
    
    <Frame>

      - Select the menu you want to synchronize
      - Check the languages you want to update
      - Click "Synchronize" to apply the structural changes across languages
  </Step>
  <Step title="Managing Language-Specific Menu Items">
    - Some menu items may need to be different in specific languages
    - To create language-specific items:
      - Switch to the specific language tab in the menu editor
      - Add new items that should appear only in that language
      - These items won't appear in other language versions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assigning Menus to Language-Specific Locations">
    - Navigate to the "Manage Locations" tab in the menu editor
    - You'll see location options for each active language
    - Assign the appropriate translated menu to each language's locations
    - Click "Save Changes" to apply the assignments
  </Step>
  <Step title="Testing Menu Translations">
    - Use the language switcher on your live site to verify:
      - Menu items display correctly in each language
      - Links point to the correct translated content
      - Dropdown functionality works properly
      - Mobile menu displays translations correctly
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Important Considerations:**

  - Menu items linked to translated content (like pages or posts) will automatically link to the correct language version
  - Custom links need manual translation, including the URL if it points to language-specific content
  - Menu structure synchronization only affects the hierarchy, not the content of menu items
  - Some themes may require additional configuration to properly display translated menus
  - WPML's String Translation module can be used for translating menu-related theme strings
  - Regular testing across languages is essential after making menu changes
  - Consider using WPML's Advanced Translation Editor for more complex menu translation projects

  - The administration email should be regularly monitored as it receives critical notifications
  - Allowing open registration may require additional security measures to prevent spam accounts
  - Time and date settings affect post publication timestamps, comment dates, and other time-sensitive features
  - Language settings only change the admin interface language, not existing content
</Warning>

### Media Settings

The Media Settings section in WordPress provides configuration options for how media files (images, documents, videos, etc.) are handled, stored, and displayed throughout your website. These settings help maintain consistency in media presentation while optimizing server storage and page load times.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Accessing Media Settings">
    - Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard

    <Frame>
      ![Image size configuration fields showing width and height inputs](./../images/tnp/gf20.png)
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  <Step title="File Organization Settings">
    - **Uploading Files Organization**: Toggle whether uploads should be organized into month and year-based folders
    - When enabled, creates a structured directory system (e.g., /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/)
    - Helps maintain an organized media library, especially for sites with numerous uploads
  </Step>
  <Step title="Image Upload Handling">
    - When an image is uploaded, WordPress automatically creates multiple versions in different sizes
    - The original image is preserved alongside the generated thumbnail, medium, and large versions
    - These different sizes are used throughout the site based on context and theme requirements
    - Additional custom image sizes may be available depending on your active theme
  </Step>
  <Step title="Maximum Upload Size">
    - While not directly configurable in the Media Settings interface, WordPress enforces upload size limits
    - The maximum upload size is determined by your hosting configuration (php.ini settings)
    - Typical limits range from 2MB to 50MB depending on your hosting plan
  </Step>
  <Step title="Responsive Images">
    - WordPress automatically generates HTML for responsive images using srcset attributes
    - This allows browsers to choose the most appropriately sized image based on the user's device
    - Improves page load times and reduces bandwidth usage on mobile devices
    - No specific configuration is required as this functionality is built into core
  </Step>
  <Step title="Saving Changes">
    - Click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply all modifications
    - WordPress confirms successful updates with a notification message
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="info">
  **Important Considerations:**

  - Changing image dimensions does not affect existing uploads, only newly uploaded images
  - Larger image dimensions provide better quality but consume more storage space and bandwidth
  - The "Crop" option forces images to exact dimensions, which may distort some images
  - Organizing uploads by month/year improves server file management but creates longer file paths
  - Very large media libraries may benefit from third-party solutions for advanced media management
  - Consider image optimization plugins to further reduce file sizes without quality loss
  - Some hosting providers have strict upload size limitations that cannot be changed in WordPress settings
