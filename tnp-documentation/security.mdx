## Best Security Practices

This section outlines critical security measures that should be implemented to protect WordPress installations against the vulnerabilities described earlier. Each recommendation includes practical implementation steps.

### Server-Level Security

<Card title="Server-Level Security" icon="server">
  Server-level security forms the foundation of WordPress security by hardening the underlying infrastructure that hosts your WordPress installation.
</Card>

#### File Permissions

<Callout type="info">
  Proper file permissions are critical to prevent unauthorized access to WordPress files. The principle of least privilege should be applied to all files and directories.
</Callout>

Set proper file permissions to prevent unauthorized access:

```bash
# Set directory permissions to 755
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;

# Set file permissions to 644
find /path/to/your/wordpress/install/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

Critical files should have more restrictive permissions:
```bash
600 -rw-------  /home/user/wp-config.php
```

#### Web Server Configuration

Web server configuration is essential for protecting sensitive WordPress files and directories from direct access. Properly configured web servers can block many common attack vectors.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Apache Configuration">
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Protect wp-config.php">
        ```apache
        <Files "wp-config.php">
        Require all denied
        </Files>
        ```
      </Accordion>
      
      <Accordion title="Secure wp-includes directory">
        ```apache
        # Block the include-only files
        <IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteBase /
        RewriteRule ^wp-admin/includes/ - [F,L]
        RewriteRule !^wp-includes/ - [S=3]
        RewriteRule ^wp-includes/[^/]+\.php$ - [F,L]
        RewriteRule ^wp-includes/js/tinymce/langs/.+\.php - [F,L]
        RewriteRule ^wp-includes/theme-compat/ - [F,L]
        </IfModule>
        ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Nginx Configuration">
    ```nginx
    # Global restrictions configuration
    location = /favicon.ico {
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }
    
    location = /robots.txt {
        allow all;
        log_not_found off;
        access_log off;
    }
    
    # Deny all attempts to access hidden files
    location ~ /\. {
        deny all;
    }
    
    # Deny access to PHP files in uploads directory
    location ~* /(?:uploads|files)/.*\.php$ {
        deny all;
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

#### SSL/TLS Implementation

<Callout type="tip">
  SSL/TLS encryption protects data in transit between users and your WordPress site, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks and credential theft. It's essential for any site that handles sensitive information.
</Callout>

- Implement HTTPS using SSL/TLS certificates
- Configure proper SSL settings:

```php
# Force HTTPS for admin and login
define( 'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true );
```

For sites behind a reverse proxy:
```php
define( 'FORCE_SSL_ADMIN', true );
if( strpos( $_SERVER['HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO'], 'https') !== false )
    $_SERVER['HTTPS'] = 'on';
```

#### PHP Configuration

PHP configuration directly impacts WordPress security as PHP is the language WordPress is built on. Insecure PHP settings can expose your site to various attacks.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Keep PHP Updated">
    Maintain the latest stable PHP version compatible with your WordPress installation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure PHP Security Settings">
    ```ini
    # Enable OpCache security settings
    opcache.validate_permission = On
    opcache.validate_root = On
    opcache.restrict_api = '/some/folder/path'
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### WordPress Core Security

<Card title="WordPress Core Security" icon="wordpress">
  WordPress core security focuses on securing the WordPress application itself through proper configuration and maintenance.
</Card>

#### Keep WordPress Updated

<Callout type="warning">
  Keeping WordPress updated is one of the most effective security measures, as updates often include patches for security vulnerabilities.
</Callout>

- Enable automatic updates for minor releases:
```php
add_filter( 'auto_update_core', '__return_true' );
```

- Regularly check for and apply major updates

#### Secure wp-config.php

<Callout type="info">
  The wp-config.php file contains sensitive database credentials and security keys. Protecting this file is critical to prevent unauthorized access to your database.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Move wp-config.php outside the web root">
    Place this critical file in a directory that isn't directly accessible via the web
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add security keys and salts">
    Security keys and salts are cryptographic elements that enhance WordPress authentication security by adding random elements to password hashing. They make it significantly harder for attackers to crack passwords even if they gain access to the database.
    
    ```php
    /**
     * Authentication unique keys and salts.
     *
     * Change these to different unique phrases! You can generate these using
     * the WordPress.org secret-key service: https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
     *
     * You can change these at any point in time to invalidate all existing cookies.
     * This will force all users to have to log in again.
     */
    define('AUTH_KEY',         'unique random string');
    define('SECURE_AUTH_KEY',  'unique random string');
    define('LOGGED_IN_KEY',    'unique random string');
    define('NONCE_KEY',        'unique random string');
    define('AUTH_SALT',        'unique random string');
    define('SECURE_AUTH_SALT', 'unique random string');
    define('LOGGED_IN_SALT',   'unique random string');
    define('NONCE_SALT',       'unique random string');
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Implementation Steps:**
  1. Visit the WordPress.org secret-key service: https://api.wordpress.org/secret-key/1.1/salt/
  2. Copy the generated keys and salts
  3. Replace the placeholder values in your wp-config.php file
  4. Save the file
</Note>

<Callout type="tip">
  **Security Benefits:**
  - Strengthens the encryption of authentication cookies
  - Makes brute-force attacks on cookies computationally infeasible
  - Provides a way to force all users to re-authenticate (by changing the keys)
  - Adds a unique security layer specific to your installation
</Callout>

<Warning>
  **Best Practices:**
  - Never use default or example values
  - Generate completely random strings using the WordPress API
  - Change these values if you suspect a security breach
  - Keep these values confidential and never share them
</Warning>

Additional wp-config.php security measures:

```php
// Disable file editing in the admin area
define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true );

// Use a custom database table prefix
$table_prefix = 'unique_prefix_'; // Only numbers, letters, and underscores
```

#### Secure WordPress Login

<Callout type="warning">
  The WordPress login page is a primary target for brute force attacks. Implementing additional security measures can significantly reduce this risk.
</Callout>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Two-Factor Authentication" icon="key">
    Implement 2FA to require a second verification method beyond passwords
  </Card>
