# Generic WordPress Functionalities

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the generic WordPress functionalities available in the Tonga National Portal administration panel.

## Authentication System

### Definition

The WordPress Authentication System is a comprehensive security framework that manages user identity verification and access control within the WordPress administration panel. It ensures that only authorized users can access the admin dashboard and its various functionalities based on their assigned roles and permissions.

Key components of the authentication system include:

- **User credentials storage**: Securely stores usernames and password hashes in the WordPress database
- **Login mechanism**: Processes user login attempts and validates credentials
- **Session management**: Creates and maintains secure user sessions after successful authentication
- **Access control**: Restricts access to specific areas based on user roles and capabilities
- **Security features**: Implements protection against unauthorized access attempts

The authentication system serves as the gateway to the WordPress administration panel, providing a balance between security and usability while protecting sensitive site data and functionality.

### Login Process

The WordPress login process follows a structured sequence of steps to verify user identity and establish a secure session. Below is a detailed explanation of the standard login workflow:

1. **Accessing the Login Page**
   - Navigate to the login URL.
   - The system presents a login form requesting username/email and password
   ![Login form showing username and password fields](./../images/tnp/gf1.png)

2. **Credential Submission**
   - User enters their username or email address and password
   - User clicks the "Log In" button or presses Enter to submit credentials
   - The form data is submitted via POST request to the server

3. **Server-side Validation**
   - WordPress validates the submitted credentials against stored user data
   - The system checks if the username/email exists in the database
   - If found, the submitted password is verified against the stored password hash
   - Failed login attempts may trigger security measures (like temporary lockouts)

4. **Session Establishment**
   - Upon successful validation, WordPress creates a new authenticated session
   - Authentication cookies are set in the user's browser:
     - `wordpress_[hash]`: Contains the authenticated user information
     - `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]`: Indicates the user is logged in
     - `wordpress_sec_[hash]`: Used for password-based cookie authentication
   - These cookies are encrypted and contain expiration timestamps

5. **Redirection**
   - New users are typically directed to their profile page
   - Returning users are redirected to:
     - The admin dashboard by default
     - A specific page if a redirect parameter was included in the login URL
     - The page they were attempting to access before being prompted to log in
     ![Admin dashboard after successful login](./../images/tnp/gf2.png)

**Important Security Considerations:**

- WordPress uses nonces (number used once) to prevent CSRF attacks during login
- Failed login attempts are logged and may trigger security measures
- The login page can be protected with additional security layers (like 2FA)
- All login communication should occur over HTTPS to prevent credential interception

### Authentication Methods

WordPress supports multiple authentication methods to accommodate different security requirements and user preferences. Each method offers distinct advantages in terms of security, convenience, and implementation complexity.

#### 1. Standard Username/Password Authentication

The default authentication method built into WordPress core:

- **Implementation**: Users enter their username/email and password on the login form
- **Security Level**: Basic (can be enhanced with password policies)
- **User Experience**: Familiar login process requiring memorization of credentials
- **Best Practices**:
  - Enforce strong password policies
  - Implement account lockouts after failed attempts
  - Regularly prompt for password changes

#### 2. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Adds an additional verification layer beyond passwords:

- **Implementation**: Requires plugins like "Two Factor Authentication" or "Wordfence"
- **Security Level**: High (significantly reduces account compromise risk)
- **Methods**:
  - Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) via authenticator apps
  - SMS verification codes
  - Email verification codes
  - Hardware security keys (like YubiKey)
- **User Flow**:
  1. User enters username/password
  2. System prompts for the second factor
  3. User provides the verification code or uses the security key

#### 3. Single Sign-On (SSO)

Allows authentication through external identity providers:

- **Implementation**: Requires plugins like "OAuth Single Sign On" or "SAML SSO"
- **Security Level**: Varies based on the identity provider's security
- **Providers**:
  - Google Workspace
  - Microsoft Azure AD
  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Other OAuth/SAML providers
- **Benefits**:
  - Reduces password fatigue
  - Centralizes authentication management
  - Often includes additional security features

#### 4. Application Passwords

Secure method for API and application access:

- **Implementation**: Built into WordPress core (since version 5.6)
- **Security Level**: High (limited-scope access tokens)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Mobile apps
  - REST API access
  - Programmatic site management
- **Management**: Users can create and revoke application-specific passwords from their profile

#### 5. Cookie-Based Authentication

The standard method WordPress uses to maintain sessions:

- **Implementation**: Built into WordPress core
- **Security Level**: Moderate
- **Cookie Types**:
  - Authentication cookies
  - Login cookies
  - Session cookies
- **Security Considerations**:
  - Cookies are encrypted
  - Include expiration timestamps
  - Can be configured for different lifespans

**Implementation Considerations:**

- Multiple authentication methods can be used simultaneously
- Authentication can be customized via hooks and filters
- Enterprise environments often require more robust methods (SSO, 2FA)
- All authentication should occur over HTTPS connections

### Logout Process

The WordPress logout process securely terminates user sessions and removes authentication cookies to prevent unauthorized access. Understanding this process is crucial for maintaining security and managing user sessions effectively.

#### Standard Logout Procedure

1. **Initiating Logout**
   - User clicks the "Log Out" link in the admin bar or profile menu
   - This link points to: `wp-login.php?action=logout`
   - A nonce parameter is included to prevent CSRF attacks
   ![Admin bar highlighting the logout option](./../images/tnp/gf3.png)

2. **Server-side Processing**
   - WordPress validates the logout request and nonce
   - The system clears the user's session data from the server
   - All WordPress authentication cookies are invalidated:
     - `wordpress_[hash]`
     - `wordpress_logged_in_[hash]`
     - `wordpress_sec_[hash]`

3. **Confirmation and Redirection**
   - User receives confirmation of successful logout
   - System redirects to:
     - The login page by default
     - A custom URL if specified in the configuration

#### Automatic Logout Scenarios

WordPress may automatically terminate sessions under certain conditions:

- **Session Expiration**
  - Authentication cookies have built-in expiration times
  - Default session length is 2 days (configurable)
  - After expiration, users must re-authenticate

- **Password Changes**
  - When a user changes their password, all existing sessions are terminated
  - This security measure prevents access with compromised credentials

- **User Role Changes**
  - Modifications to a user's role or capabilities may trigger session termination
  - Ensures users can't retain access beyond their current permissions

- **Manual Session Management**
  - Administrators can force-logout users using plugins
  - Useful for security incidents or maintenance periods

#### Security Best Practices

- **Complete Logout**
  - Users should be instructed to close their browser after logout for complete session termination
  - Some browser features (like session restore) may retain cookies

- **Idle Session Timeout**
  - Consider implementing automatic logout after periods of inactivity
  - Requires additional plugins or custom code
  - Particularly important for shared computers or public environments

- **Logout Verification**
  - Confirm successful logout to users
  - Provide clear instructions if additional steps are needed

- **Multi-device Management**
  - Modern WordPress installations track login sessions across devices
  - Users can view and terminate specific sessions from their profile

**Technical Implementation Note:**
The logout process uses the `wp_logout()` function which triggers the 'wp_logout' action hook, allowing developers to perform additional cleanup or logging operations during logout.

## Users Management

### Definition

The WordPress Users Management system is a comprehensive framework that allows administrators to create, modify, and manage user accounts within the WordPress platform. It provides tools for controlling access to the website's administrative functions based on predefined roles and capabilities.

Key components of the Users Management system include:

- **User accounts**: Individual profiles containing personal information, credentials, and role assignments
- **Role-based access control**: Predefined sets of permissions that determine what actions users can perform
- **User capabilities**: Granular permissions that can be assigned or removed from specific roles
- **User metadata**: Additional information associated with user accounts
- **Authentication management**: Tools for password resets, account recovery, and security

The Users Management system serves as the foundation for WordPress's security model, ensuring that users have appropriate access to site functionality while protecting sensitive operations from unauthorized access.

   - In List view, sort by columns (Name, Author, Date)

5. **Managing Media Files**
   - **Edit**: Modify file title, caption, alt text, and description
   - **Delete**: Remove files from the Media Library
   - **View**: Open the file in a new browser tab
   - **Copy URL**: Get the direct link to the media file
   - **Bulk Actions**: Select multiple files to delete or edit in batch

**Important Considerations:**

- The Media Library displays all uploaded files, regardless of whether they're currently used in content
- Deleting a media file will remove it from any posts or pages where it's embedded
- Large media libraries may load slowly and benefit from additional organization plugins
- WordPress automatically organizes uploaded files into year/month folders on the server
- Regular backups of the uploads directory are essential for preserving media assets

## Platform Settings

### Definition

The WordPress Platform Settings system is a comprehensive framework that allows administrators to configure and customize core aspects of the WordPress installation. It provides centralized control over site-wide settings that affect how the website functions, appears, and interacts with users and search engines.

Key components of the Platform Settings system include:

- **General settings**: Basic site information and configuration options
- **Writing settings**: Default post categories, formats, and publishing options
- **Reading settings**: Homepage display, post visibility, and RSS feed options
- **Discussion settings**: Comment moderation and notification preferences
- **Media settings**: Image sizes, upload directories, and media handling options
- **Permalink settings**: URL structure for posts, pages, and archives
- **Privacy settings**: Privacy policy page and data handling configurations

The Platform Settings system serves as the foundation for customizing WordPress to meet specific site requirements, ensuring consistent behavior across the entire website while providing flexibility for administrators to tailor the platform to their needs.

### Basic Site Configuration

The Basic Site Configuration section, found under "Settings" > "General" in the WordPress admin panel, provides essential options for defining your site's identity and core functionality. Below is a detailed explanation of these fundamental settings:

1. **Accessing General Settings**
   - Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard
   - Navigate to "Settings" > "General" in the left sidebar menu
   ![Settings menu in the WordPress admin sidebar highlighting the General option](./../images/tnp/gf19.png)

2. **Site Identity Settings**
   - **Site Title**: The name of your website, displayed in browser tabs, search results, and various theme locations
   - **Tagline**: A brief description of your site that appears in some themes and can influence SEO
   - These elements define your site's identity across the web and in search engine results

3. **Site Address Configuration**
   - **WordPress Address (URL)**: The location of your WordPress core files (typically your domain)
   - **Site Address (URL)**: The address visitors use to access your site (usually identical to WordPress Address)
   - These settings are critical for proper site functioning and should only be changed with caution

4. **Contact Information**
   - **Administration Email Address**: The primary contact email for site notifications
   - Used for administrative communications, password resets, and system alerts
   - Must be a valid, accessible email address to ensure you receive important notifications

5. **Membership Settings**
   - **Membership**: Toggle whether anyone can register for an account on your site
   - **New User Default Role**: Select the role automatically assigned to newly registered users
   - These settings control public access to your site's registration features

6. **Date and Time Configuration**
   - **Timezone**: Set your local timezone using a city reference or UTC offset
   - **Date Format**: Choose how dates appear throughout your site
   - **Time Format**: Select the preferred time display format (12 or 24-hour)
   - **Week Starts On**: Define which day is considered the first day of the week
   - These settings ensure consistent date and time display across your entire website

7. **Language Settings**
   - **Site Language**: Select the primary language for the WordPress admin interface
   - This setting affects the admin dashboard language, not necessarily the content language
   - Additional languages can be installed if needed

8. **Saving Changes**
   - Click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply all modifications
   - WordPress confirms successful updates with a notification message

**Important Considerations:**

- Changing the site URL settings incorrectly can make your site inaccessible
- The site title and tagline significantly impact SEO and should be chosen carefully
- The administration email should be regularly monitored as it receives critical notifications
- Allowing open registration may require additional security measures to prevent spam accounts
- Time and date settings affect post publication timestamps, comment dates, and other time-sensitive features
- Language settings only change the admin interface language, not existing content

### Media Settings

The Media Settings section in WordPress provides configuration options for how media files (images, documents, videos, etc.) are handled, stored, and displayed throughout your website. These settings help maintain consistency in media presentation while optimizing server storage and page load times.

1. **Accessing Media Settings**
   - Log in to the WordPress admin dashboard
   - Navigate to "Settings" > "Media" in the left sidebar menu

2. **Image Size Configuration**
   - **Thumbnail Size**: Define the dimensions for thumbnail images
     - Default: 150×150 pixels
     - Used in admin listings and theme-specific thumbnail displays
   - **Medium Size**: Set dimensions for medium-sized images
     - Default: 300×300 pixels maximum
     - Commonly used in blog post listings and archive pages
   - **Large Size**: Configure dimensions for large images
     - Default: 1024×1024 pixels maximum
     - Often used for featured images in single post views
   - **Crop Settings**: Choose whether images are cropped to exact dimensions or proportionally scaled
   ![Image size configuration fields showing width and height inputs](./../images/tnp/gf20.png)

3. **File Organization Settings**
   - **Uploading Files Organization**: Toggle whether uploads should be organized into month and year-based folders
   - When enabled, creates a structured directory system (e.g., /wp-content/uploads/2025/05/)
   - Helps maintain an organized media library, especially for sites with numerous uploads

4. **Image Upload Handling**
   - When an image is uploaded, WordPress automatically creates multiple versions in different sizes
   - The original image is preserved alongside the generated thumbnail, medium, and large versions
   - These different sizes are used throughout the site based on context and theme requirements
   - Additional custom image sizes may be available depending on your active theme

5. **Maximum Upload Size**
   - While not directly configurable in the Media Settings interface, WordPress enforces upload size limits
   - The maximum upload size is determined by your hosting configuration (php.ini settings)
   - Typical limits range from 2MB to 50MB depending on your hosting plan

6. **Responsive Images**
   - WordPress automatically generates HTML for responsive images using srcset attributes
   - This allows browsers to choose the most appropriately sized image based on the user's device
   - Improves page load times and reduces bandwidth usage on mobile devices
   - No specific configuration is required as this functionality is built into core

7. **Saving Changes**
   - Click the "Save Changes" button at the bottom of the page to apply all modifications
   - WordPress confirms successful updates with a notification message

**Important Considerations:**

- Changing image dimensions does not affect existing uploads, only newly uploaded images
- Larger image dimensions provide better quality but consume more storage space and bandwidth
- The "Crop" option forces images to exact dimensions, which may distort some images
- Organizing uploads by month/year improves server file management but creates longer file paths
- Very large media libraries may benefit from third-party solutions for advanced media management
- Consider image optimization plugins to further reduce file sizes without quality loss
- Some hosting providers have strict upload size limitations that cannot be changed in WordPress settings
