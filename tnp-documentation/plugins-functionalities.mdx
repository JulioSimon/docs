## MxChat

### Description

<Card title="MxChat" icon="message">
  MxChat is a powerful AI-powered chatbot plugin for WordPress developed by MxChat that enhances the Tonga National Portal's user engagement and support capabilities. This versatile solution integrates advanced language models including OpenAI's GPT, Anthropic's Claude, Google's Gemini, xAI's Grok, and DeepSeek to provide intelligent, real-time interactions with portal visitors.
</Card>

The plugin creates an intuitive chat interface that can be embedded throughout the portal, allowing citizens to quickly find information, get assistance with government services, and receive immediate responses to their queries without waiting for human support. MxChat significantly reduces the burden on support staff by handling routine inquiries automatically while providing a seamless escalation path to human agents when necessary.

What sets MxChat apart is its ability to be trained on the Tonga National Portal's specific content, including pages, posts, documents, and custom knowledge base entries. This ensures that responses are contextually relevant to Tongan government services, policies, and procedures rather than generic information. The chatbot becomes an extension of the portal's information architecture, making government resources more accessible to citizens through natural conversation.
