## Platform Purpose and Overview

The Citizen Portal is a comprehensive digital platform designed to streamline interactions between government entities and citizens. Built on modern web technologies, this platform serves as a centralized hub for various government services, enabling efficient management of administrative tasks, citizen requests, and public information.

<Note>
The platform addresses several key challenges in government administration:

- **Fragmented Service Delivery**: Consolidates various government services into a single, unified platform
- **Administrative Inefficiency**: Automates routine tasks and streamlines workflows
- **Limited Accessibility**: Provides 24/7 online access to government services
- **Communication Gaps**: Facilitates direct communication between citizens and government officials
- **Resource Management**: Optimizes allocation and utilization of government resources
</Note>

## Technology Stack

The platform is built using a robust and modern technology stack:

<div className="overflow-x-auto">
  <table className="min-w-full">
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th className="px-4 py-2 bg-slate-100 dark:bg-slate-800">Component</th>

## Panel Descriptions

The platform consists of two distinct panels, each serving different user groups:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Admin Panel">
    The Admin Panel is designed for government staff and administrators. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing government operations, citizen requests, and internal workflows. Key features include:

    - **Tenant-Based Architecture**: Each government ministry (entity) operates within its own isolated environment
    - **Role-Based Access Control**: Different permission levels for administrators, managers, and staff
    - **Comprehensive Dashboard**: Real-time analytics and insights into government operations
    - **Advanced Management Tools**: For appointments, tickets, documents, vacancies, and e-services
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="App Panel">
    The App Panel serves as the citizen-facing interface of the platform. It provides a user-friendly experience for accessing government services, submitting requests, and tracking their status. Key features include:

    - **Personalized Dashboard**: Displays information relevant to the logged-in citizen
    - **Service Request System**: For submitting and tracking various government service requests
    - **Document Management**: Access to personal documents and government forms
    - **Appointment Booking**: Schedule meetings with government officials
    - **Job Application System**: Apply for government job vacancies
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## System Architecture Overview

The platform follows a multi-tenant architecture with a clear separation between the Admin and App panels:

            VacancySystem["Vacancy\nSystem"]
            EServicesSystem["E-Services System"]
        end
        
        AdminPanel --- SharedServices
        AppPanel --- SharedServices
        SharedServices --- CoreModules
    end
```
</Frame>
The system uses Laravel's robust ORM for database interactions and follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern. FilamentPHP provides the admin panel framework, while Livewire enables dynamic, reactive user interfaces without complex JavaScript.
