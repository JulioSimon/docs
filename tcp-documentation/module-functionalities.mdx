## Data Flow Between Modules

The Citizen Portal features a sophisticated integration system that enables seamless data flow between modules, ensuring a cohesive user experience and efficient administrative processes. This section explains how information moves between the Admin and App panels, and how different modules interact with each other.

### Citizen Ticket Request Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Submission">
    - Citizen submits a ticket service request through the App Panel's Ticketing System
    - System creates a new Ticket record with a unique ticket code
    - Initial status is set to "New"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routing">
    - Request is automatically routed to the appropriate entity and department
    - Routing is based on the entity and department selected by the citizen
    - System applies business rules to determine priority based on category
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assignment">
    - Staff member is assigned to handle the request
    - Assignment can be manual or automatic based on workload balancing
    - Assigned staff receives notification of new ticket
  </Step>
  <Step title="Processing">
    - Staff processes the request through the Admin Panel
    - Status updates are recorded in the ticket timeline
    - Each status change triggers notifications to the citizen
  </Step>
  <Step title="Communication">
    - Staff and citizen exchange messages through the ticket interface
    - All communications are stored in the ticket timeline
    - Rich text formatting enables clear communication
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    - Request is resolved and marked as completed
    - Final status update is recorded
    - Resolution details are documented
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Technical Details">
    - Tickets are linked to entities, departments, categories, and statuses through database relationships
    - The `TicketResource` class in both Admin and App panels provides different views of the same data
    - The Admin panel filters tickets by assigned staff and entity permissions
    - The App panel filters tickets by the authenticated user's ID
    - Timeline entries are stored in a separate table with polymorphic relationships
